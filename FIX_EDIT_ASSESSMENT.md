# Fix: Edit Assessment Questions Not Loading

## Problem
When opening edit assessment page, questions show (1/25) instead of (25/25). The 25 questions from the assessment are not being loaded.

## Root Cause
The new backend endpoint `GET /skill-assessment/developer/assessments/:assessmentId` was added but backend server needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server ⭐

**Stop the backend server:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the backend

**Restart the backend server:**
```bash
cd d:\purwadhika\final-project\job-board-api
npm run dev
```

**Verify the server started successfully:**
- Check console for: `API Running: http://localhost:4400`
- No TypeScript compilation errors

### Step 2: Test the Endpoint

**Using Browser DevTools:**
1. Open edit assessment page
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Look for request to `/skill-assessment/developer/assessments/4`
4. Check if it returns 200 OK with questions data

**Using curl:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:4400/skill-assessment/developer/assessments/4 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Assessment retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 4,
    "title": "JavaScript",
    "description": "Test your advanced JavaScript knowledge",
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "question": "What is closure?",
        "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
        "answer": "A"
      },
      // ... 24 more questions
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Frontend

**After backend restart:**
1. Refresh the edit assessment page
2. Should see "Questions (25/25)"
3. All 25 questions should be pre-filled
4. Can edit any question
5. Can save changes

## Fallback Behavior

If endpoint is still not available, the frontend will:
1. Show toast notification: "Questions could not be loaded. Please restart backend server."
2. Display 1 empty question
3. User can manually add questions (not ideal)

## Files Changed

### Backend
1. **Router** (`src/routers/skillAssessment.router.ts`)
   - Added: `GET /developer/assessments/:assessmentId`

2. **Controller** (`src/controllers/skillAssessment/skillAssessment.controller.ts`)
   - Added: `getAssessmentById()` method

3. **Service** (`src/services/skillAssessment/skillAssessment.service.ts`)
   - Added: `getAssessmentByIdForDeveloper()` method

### Frontend
1. **API Function** (`src/lib/skillAssessment.ts`)
   - Updated: `getAssessmentById()` with fallback

2. **Edit Page** (`src/app/developer/skill-assessment/edit/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Added: Warning toast if questions not loaded

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing (1/25) after restart
**Check:**
1. Backend console for errors
2. Browser console for API errors
3. Network tab for 404 or 500 errors

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check if token is valid

### Issue: 403 Forbidden
**Cause:** Not logged in as DEVELOPER role

**Solution:**
- Login with developer account
- Check localStorage for token
- Verify role in token

### Issue: 404 Not Found
**Cause:** Route not registered properly

**Solution:**
- Check `app.ts` line 198: `this.app.use("/skill-assessment", ...)`
- Verify router class instantiation
- Check route order (specific before general)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend server restarted successfully
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Edit page loads without errors
- [ ] Questions show (25/25)
- [ ] All questions pre-filled with correct data
- [ ] Can edit question text
- [ ] Can edit options
- [ ] Can change correct answer
- [ ] Can add/remove questions
- [ ] Can save changes
- [ ] Changes persist after save

## Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**
- Questions (1/25)
- Empty question form
- Need to re-enter all 25 questions

**After Fix:**
- Questions (25/25)
- All questions pre-filled
- Can edit existing questions
- Much better UX!

## Notes

- The fallback ensures the page doesn't break
- But proper fix requires backend restart
- This is a one-time setup issue
- Once endpoint is available, will work perfectly
